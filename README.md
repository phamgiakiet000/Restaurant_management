## Introduction

A restaurant system, whether large or small, must have a central management system. The main divisions include: Account, bill, billinfo, food, foodCategory and TableFood. Those components are called entities. They interact with each other to create a restaurant management system.
The main tasks of the entities are as follows:
- Account includes many employees with different positions. But here we only consider admin and staff as the two main positions.
- Bill is the food bill ordered for each table to pay
- Billinfo contains the Bill related id number of each table to record the items called by each Bill for easy payment.
- Food includes dishes and drinks.
-TableFood is used to control the number of tables and operating status in the restaurant.
- FoodCategory is a warehouse used to classify food.
